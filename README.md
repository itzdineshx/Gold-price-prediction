## **Introduction**  
Gold prices are highly volatile and influenced by numerous economic factors. Accurate price prediction can assist investors and traders in making informed decisions. This project applies various machine learning and time-series models to predict gold prices using historical data.

---

## **Dataset**
- **Source:** [Exchange Rate.org](https://www.exchange-rates.org/precious-metals/gold-price/india)  
- **Description:** Historical gold prices with corresponding currency rates, economic indicators, or other relevant features.  
- **Sample Columns:**  
  - Date  
  - Gold Price in INR  
  - USD/INR Exchange Rate  

---

## **Features**
Key features used in the model:
- **Date:** Time-series index for the analysis  
- **Gold Price:** Target variable for prediction  
- **USD/INR Exchange Rate:** Currency conversion rates  

---

## **Installation**

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Gold_price_prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## **Usage**
1. Run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Gold_price_usdinr_prediction.ipynb
   ```

2. Start the Gradio interface for user-friendly interaction:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

---

## **Modeling Techniques**
The following models were explored and compared:
- **Linear Regression:** Simple regression model for baseline predictions.  
- **Ridge Regression:** Regularized regression to handle overfitting.  
- **Random Forest:** Ensemble method for robust predictions.  

---

## **Evaluation Metrics**
Key evaluation metrics used:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**  
- **R-Squared Score (R¬≤)**  

---

## **Results**
| **Model**               | **MSE**        | **RMSE**       | **R-Squared** |
|--------------------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| Linear Regression        | 75,693.83     | 122.12         | 0.724         |
| Best Ridge Regression    | 77,648.52     | 278.65         | 0.717         |
| Random Forest            | 81,500.74     | 285.48         | 0.703         |
